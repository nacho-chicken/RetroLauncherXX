Because code is taken from two separate repos, I have chosen to only
track the files that need modifications.

Code is branched from the following repos and commits:

muxtweakgen/main.c, muxtweakgen/ui/ui_scrTweakGeneral.c:
https://github.com/MustardOS/frontend/
94a1baa1172956aed1c31505571c3ac8511e61a9

script/mux/frontend.sh, script/mux/launch.sh, script/launch/lr-general.sh, script/system/startup.sh:
https://github.com/MustardOS/internal/
12380dc6d41127073024552cb581a29154667f40

Build instructions:

1) Compile muxtweakgen
Only muxtweakgen needs building, since the other files are bash script files.
- Clone the frontend repo listed above
- Checkout the branch specified
- Replace the muxtweakgen files from the cloned repo with the altered ones from this repo
- Build muxtweakgen as normal

2) Place the compiled muxtweakgen binary, as well as all the script files into home/muos/retrolauncherxx/

3) Compress the included mnt and home directories into a .zip file named "RetroLauncher XX.zip"
